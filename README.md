# MediaOrganiser
Media Organiser - Search App Project (29/04/2019)

This project was created as a final assessment for my Apprenticeship. In which I was given a short brief to design a media organiser application. The task was done in complete isolation over one week per assessment rules.

## Outline
"The Media Organiser is a standalone component which will support the organisation of media files on desktop computers. The component will support a range of video and audio files located on the users local file system. During runtime the component will be able to change it’s scope, save it’s state and manage files."

## Software used
To create the application, I used Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) in the C# language. The work was done in the Visual Studio 2019 IDE, it followed the MVVM (Models, Views, View Models) architectural pattern with implementation using Caliburn.Micro framework.
